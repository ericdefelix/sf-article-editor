	<p data-mce-style="color: #222222; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;" style="color: #222222; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">The organization&#39;s bylaws establish seven classes of membership, including individual or regular members, associate individual members, and local chapters. Regular membership is limited to young men between the ages of 18 and 35, while associate membership is available to individuals or groups ineligible for regular membership, principally women and older men. An associate members, whose dues are somewhat lower than those charged regular members, may not vote, hold local or national office, or participate in certain leadership training and awards programs. The bylaws define a local chapter as &quot;[a]ny young men&#39;s organization of good repute existing in any community within the United States, organized for purposes similar to and consistent with those&quot; of the national organization. App. to Juris. Statement A98. The ultimate policymaking authority of the Jaycees rests with an annual national convention, consisting of delegates from each local chapter, with a national president and board of directors. At the time of trial in August 1981, the Jaycees had approximately 295,000 members in 7,400 local chapters affiliated with 51 state organizations. There were at that time about 11,915 associate members. The national organization&#39;s executive vice president estimated at trial that women associate members make up about two percent of the Jaycees&#39; total membership. Tr. 56.</p>

Currently, the memberships and boards of directors of both chapters include a substantial proportion of women. As a result, the two chapters have been in violation of the national organization&#39;s bylaws for about 10 years. The national organization has imposed a number of sanctions on the Minneapolis and St. Paul chapters for violating the bylaws, including denying their members eligibility for state or national office or awards programs, and refusing to count their membership in computing votes at national conventions.</p>

Shortly after receiving this notification, members of both chapters filed charges of discrimination with the Minnesota Department of Human Rights. The complaints alleged that the exclusion of women from full membership required by the national organization&#39;s bylaws violated the Minnesota Human Rights Act (Act), which provides in part:</p>

	<p data-mce-style="color: #222222; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;" style="color: #222222; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">The term &quot;place of public accommodation&quot; is defined in the Act as &quot;a business, accommodation, refreshment, entertainment, recreation, or transportation facility of any kind, whether licensed or not, whose goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages or accommodations are extended, offered, sold, or otherwise made available to the public.&quot; &sect; 363.01, subd. 18.</p>

	<p data-mce-style="color: #222222; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;" style="color: #222222; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">After an investigation, the Commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Human Rights found probable cause to believe that the sanctions imposed on the local chapters by the national organization violated the statute and ordered that an evidentiary hearing be held before a state hearing examiner. Before that hearing took place, however, the national organization brought suit against various state officials, appellants here, in the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent enforcement of the Act. The complaint alleged that, by requiring the organization to accept women as regular members, application of the Act would violate the male members&#39; constitutional rights of free speech and association. With the agreement of the parties, the District Court dismissed the suit without prejudice, stating that it could be renewed in the event the state administrative proceeding resulted in a ruling adverse to the Jaycees.</p>

Office of Hearing Examiners for the Dept. of Human Rights, Oct. 9, 1979) (hereinafter Report), App. to Juris. Statement A107-A109. The Jaycees then filed a renewed complaint in the District Court, which in turn certified to the Minnesota Supreme Court the question whether the Jaycees organization is a &quot;place of public accommodation&quot; within the meaning of the State&#39;s Human Rights Act.

It then concluded that the Jaycees organization (a) is a &quot;business&quot; in that it sells goods and extends privileges in exchange for annual membership dues; (b) is a &quot;public&quot; business in that it solicits and recruits dues-paying members based on unselective criteria; and (c) is a public business &quot;facility&quot; in that it conducts its activities at fixed and mobile sites within the State of Minnesota.&nbsp;<em>Id.,</em>&nbsp;at 768-774.</p>

	<p data-mce-style="color: #222222; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;" style="color: #222222; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">The organization&#39;s bylaws establish seven classes of membership, including individual or regular members, associate individual members, and local chapters. Regular membership is limited to young men between the ages of 18 and 35, while associate membership is available to individuals or groups ineligible for regular membership, principally women and older men. An associate members, whose dues are somewhat lower than those charged regular members, may not vote, hold local or national office, or participate in certain leadership training and awards programs. The bylaws define a local chapter as &quot;[a]ny young men&#39;s organization of good repute existing in any community within the United States, organized for purposes similar to and consistent with those&quot; of the national organization. App. to Juris. Statement A98. The ultimate policymaking authority of the Jaycees rests with an annual national convention, consisting of delegates from each local chapter, with a national president and board of directors. At the time of trial in August 1981, the Jaycees had approximately 295,000 members in 7,400 local chapters affiliated with 51 state organizations. There were at that time about 11,915 associate members. The national organization&#39;s executive vice president estimated at trial that women associate members make up about two percent of the Jaycees&#39; total membership. Tr. 56.</p>

As a result, the two chapters have been in violation of the national organization&#39;s bylaws for about 10 years. The national organization has imposed a number of sanctions on the Minneapolis and St. Paul chapters for violating the bylaws, including denying their members eligibility for state or national office or awards programs, and refusing to count their membership in computing votes at national conventions.</p>

	<p data-mce-style="color: #222222; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;" style="color: #222222; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">After an investigation, the Commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Human Rights found probable cause to believe that the sanctions imposed on the local chapters by the national organization violated the statute and ordered that an evidentiary hearing be held before a state hearing examiner. Before that hearing took place, however, the national organization brought suit against various state officials, appellants here, in the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent enforcement of the Act. The complaint alleged that, by requiring the organization to accept women as regular members, application of the Act would violate the male members&#39; constitutional rights of free speech and association.

It then concluded that the Jaycees organization (a) is a &quot;business&quot; in that it sells goods and extends privileges in exchange for annual membership dues; (b) is a &quot;public&quot; business in that it solicits and recruits dues-paying members based on unselective criteria; and (c) is a public business &quot;facility&quot; in that it conducts its activities at fixed and mobile sites within the State of Minnesota.&nbsp;<em>Id.,</em>&nbsp;at 768-774.</p>

	<p data-mce-style="color: #222222; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;" style="color: #222222; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">The organization&#39;s bylaws establish seven classes of membership, including individual or regular members, associate individual members, and local chapters. Regular membership is limited to young men between the ages of 18 and 35, while associate membership is available to individuals or groups ineligible for regular membership, principally women and older men. An associate members, whose dues are somewhat lower than those charged regular members, may not vote, hold local or national office, or participate in certain leadership training and awards programs. The bylaws define a local chapter as &quot;[a]ny young men&#39;s organization of good repute existing in any community within the United States, organized for purposes similar to and consistent with those&quot; of the national organization. App. to Juris. Statement A98. The ultimate policymaking authority of the Jaycees rests with an annual national convention, consisting of delegates from each local chapter, with a national president and board of directors. At the time of trial in August 1981, the Jaycees had approximately 295,000 members in 7,400 local chapters affiliated with 51 state organizations. There were at that time about 11,915 associate members. The national organization&#39;s executive vice president estimated at trial that women associate members make up about two percent of the Jaycees&#39; total membership. Tr. 56.</p>

As a result, the two chapters have been in violation of the national organization&#39;s bylaws for about 10 years. The national organization has imposed a number of sanctions on the Minneapolis and St. Paul chapters for violating the bylaws, including denying their members eligibility for state or national office or awards programs, and refusing to count their membership in computing votes at national conventions.</p>

	<p data-mce-style="color: #222222; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;" style="color: #222222; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">After an investigation, the Commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Human Rights found probable cause to believe that the sanctions imposed on the local chapters by the national organization violated the statute and ordered that an evidentiary hearing be held before a state hearing examiner. Before that hearing took place, however, the national organization brought suit against various state officials, appellants here, in the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent enforcement of the Act. The complaint alleged that, by requiring the organization to accept women as regular members, application of the Act would violate the male members&#39; constitutional rights of free speech and association. With the agreement of the parties, the District Court dismissed the suit without prejudice, stating that it could be renewed in the event the state administrative proceeding resulted in a ruling adverse to the Jaycees.</p>

The Jaycees then filed a renewed complaint in the District Court, which in turn certified to the Minnesota Supreme Court the question whether the Jaycees organization is a &quot;place of public accommodation&quot; within the meaning of the State&#39;s Human Rights Act.

Regular membership is limited to young men between the ages of 18 and 35, while associate membership is available to individuals or groups ineligible for regular membership, principally women and older men. An associate members, whose dues are somewhat lower than those charged regular members, may not vote, hold local or national office, or participate in certain leadership training and awards programs. The bylaws define a local chapter as &quot;[a]ny young men&#39;s organization of good repute existing in any community within the United States, organized for purposes similar to and consistent with those&quot; of the national organization. App. to Juris. Statement A98. The ultimate policymaking authority of the Jaycees rests with an annual national convention, consisting of delegates from each local chapter, with a national president and board of directors. At the time of trial in August 1981, the Jaycees had approximately 295,000 members in 7,400 local chapters affiliated with 51 state organizations. There were at that time about 11,915 associate members. The national organization&#39;s executive vice president estimated at trial that women associate members make up about two percent of the Jaycees&#39; total membership. Tr. 56.</p>

Before that hearing took place, however, the national organization brought suit against various state officials, appellants here, in the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent enforcement of the Act. The complaint alleged that, by requiring the organization to accept women as regular members, application of the Act would violate the male members&#39; constitutional rights of free speech and association.

	<p data-mce-style="color: #222222; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;" style="color: #222222; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Subsequently, the Jaycees amended its complaint in the District Court to add a claim that the Minnesota Supreme Court&#39;s interpretation of the Act rendered it unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. The federal suit then proceeded to trial, after which the District Court entered judgment in favor of the state officials.&nbsp;<a data-mce-href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10835232600199743074&q=human+rights&hl=en&as_sdt=2006" data-mce-style="color: #660099;" href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10835232600199743074&q=human+rights&hl=en&as_sdt=2006" rel="noopener" style="color: #660099;" target="_blank"><em>United States Jaycees</em>&nbsp;v.&nbsp;<em>McClure,</em>&nbsp;534 F.

It further decided that application of the Minnesota statute to the Jaycees&#39; membership policies would produce a &quot;direct and substantial&quot; interference with that freedom,&nbsp;<em>id.,</em>&nbsp;at 1572, because it would necessarily result in &quot;some change in the Jaycees&#39; philosophical cast,&quot;&nbsp;<em>id.,</em>&nbsp;at 1571, and would attach penal sanctions to those responsible for maintaining the policy,&nbsp;<em>id.,</em>&nbsp;at 1572. The court concluded that the State&#39;s interest in eradicating discrimination is not sufficiently compelling to outweigh this interference with the Jaycees&#39; constitutional rights, because the organization is not wholly &quot;public,&quot;&nbsp;<em>id.,</em>&nbsp;at 1571-1572, 1573, the state interest had been asserted selectively,&nbsp;<em>id.,</em>&nbsp;at 1573, and the antidiscrimination policy could be served in a number of ways less intrusive of First Amendment freedoms,&nbsp;<em>id.,</em>&nbsp;at 1573-1574.</p>
